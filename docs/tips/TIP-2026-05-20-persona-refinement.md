## Context

Seeded from TIB-2026-05-20-pr-review-engine-skill, Phases 7–8. With the
structural migration complete, this TIP refines content: split the four combo
personas into 8 sharper agents, and extract content cross-referenced by 2+
personas into `references/`.

This is the content-affecting phase. It must preserve review semantics: every
finding the old combo files would produce on a fixture diff must still be
produced by the split files. Net file count: 15 agents (was 11).

## Goals

- `ci-release-security.md` → `ci-security.md` + `release-integrity.md` + `dependencies.md`
- `ui-styling-accessibility.md` → `styling.md` + `accessibility.md`
- `code-simplifier-performance.md` → `simplification.md` + `performance.md`
- `documentation.md` retained as a single agent but with `pointer-integrity` content extracted to `references/`
- `code-quality.md` renamed to `correctness.md`; secrets/injection content extracted to `references/`
- `silent-failure-hunter.md` renamed to `error-handling.md`
- `test-coverage.md` renamed to `tests.md`
- `react-next-best-practices.md` renamed to `react-next.md`
- `ai-sdk-best-practices.md` renamed to `ai-sdk.md`
- `web3-security.md` renamed to `web3.md`
- `runtime-validation.md` unchanged
- `references/secrets.md`, `references/injection.md`, `references/effect-cleanup.md`, `references/marketplace-rubrics.md` created
- Dispatcher updated to recognize new trigger signals (`workflows-changed`, `changesets-changed`, `lockfile-changed`, `npmrc-changed`)

## Non-Goals

- Adding new finding types. Splits preserve existing scope.
- Introducing a typed trigger flag enum (the TIB explicitly avoided that).

### Modified

- `plugins/local/skills/pr-review-engine/SKILL.md` — add new trigger signals; update agent inventory section
- `CLAUDE.md` — update persona contract example if it references old persona names

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 7 — Split combos

- [ ] `ci-release-security.md` split: read it once; identify the three rubric sections; write three new agent files with `name`, `description`, `version: 0.1.0`, and the appropriate body. Delete the original.
- [ ] `ui-styling-accessibility.md` split: same pattern, two outputs.
- [ ] `code-simplifier-performance.md` split: same pattern, two outputs.
- [ ] Rename the remaining personas per the table above using `git mv`.
- [ ] Update `pr-review-engine/SKILL.md` Step 5 inventory and Step 4 flag detection (add `workflows-changed`, `changesets-changed`, `lockfile-changed`, `npmrc-changed`).

### Phase 8 — Extract shared rubrics

- [ ] Audit each new agent for duplicated rubric text against the four target categories (secrets, injection, effect-cleanup, marketplace-rubrics).
- [ ] Write each `references/<topic>.md` once.
- [ ] Replace the duplicated text in agents with the pointer line: `Cross-check `references/<topic>.md` when this concern applies.`

## Block validation

- [ ] `find plugins/local/skills/pr-review-engine/agents -name '*.md' | wc -l` returns 15.
- [ ] `find plugins/local/skills/pr-review-engine/references -name '*.md' | wc -l` returns 4.
- [ ] No agent file mentions a marketplace rubric (`building-components`, `ai-elements`, `streamdown`, `web-design-guidelines`, `tailwind-design-system`, `next-best-practices`, `vercel-react-best-practices`, `vercel-composition-patterns`) inline; all such references go through `references/marketplace-rubrics.md`.
- [ ] Each `agents/<name>.md` has frontmatter `name`, `description`, `version` (semver).

## Verification Checklist

- structural greps above
- per-finding spot check: pick 3 lines from each pre-split combo and confirm an equivalent line exists in the corresponding new agent

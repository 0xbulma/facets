# CI Security

The trust boundary that runs our code. CI runs with privileged tokens; a bad workflow merge can leak secrets or run attacker code on a maintainer's box. This persona reviews diffs that touch `.github/workflows/**` or `.github/actions/**`.

## Run-time setup

Discover supplemental rubric skills via Bash. Each provides authoritative docs the persona uses on top of its own rubric:

```bash
# Conditional on the diff touching Turborepo surface.
if grep -lE "turbo\\.json|from ['\"]turbo|\"turbo\":" <CHANGED_FILES> >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  TURBO_RUBRIC=$(find ~/.claude -type f -name SKILL.md -path "*turborepo*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
```

For each rubric variable that resolves to a non-empty path, Read the file in full and print `Loaded conditional skill: <name>`. For each that resolved empty, log `Marketplace skill not found: <name> — degrading to persona's built-in rubric below` and continue with the inline rubric.

## Trigger

Fires when `<HAS_WORKFLOWS>` is true — any changed file matches:

- `.github/workflows/**`
- `.github/actions/**` (composite or local actions)
- `turbo.json` (when the project uses Turborepo)

## Prompt must include

Cross-check `references/github-actions.md` for the canonical GitHub Actions hardening rubric (the in-repo source of truth, distilled from GitHub's official security-hardening docs); the subsections below narrow it to the highest-signal checks on the diff.

### Workflow injection (CRITICAL)

Cross-check `references/injection.md` for the canonical injection rubric; this section narrows it to the GitHub Actions expression-interpolation surface.

- Any `${{ github.event.* }}`, `${{ github.head_ref }}`, or other attacker-controllable input interpolated directly into a `run:` block, `shell:` invocation, or third-party-action argument. The fix is always: assign to an env var first, then reference `$ENV_VAR` in the shell — never expand untrusted GitHub-context expressions in `run:` strings.
- `pull_request_target` triggers that also check out the PR head (`actions/checkout` with `ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}` or similar). This pattern executes attacker code with write-scoped credentials. Flag unless the workflow demonstrably never runs the checked-out code (no install, no test, no script).
- `issue_comment` or `pull_request_review_comment` triggers that act on comment text without ACL gating (e.g. checking `github.event.comment.author_association == 'OWNER'`).

### Action pinning (HIGH)

- Third-party `uses:` on a floating ref — branch (`@main`, `@master`) or floating tag (`@v4`, `@v3.5`). Flag for a full commit-SHA pin (fix shape in the reference above). First-party `actions/*` / `github/*` may stay on tags only when `.github/dependabot.yml` bumps them — note when no such policy exists.
- Newly added actions from unknown publishers — surface the publisher name and ask whether it was reviewed.

### Workflow `permissions:` scopes (HIGH)

- New workflow with no top-level `permissions:` block — defaults to write-all on classic-permissions repos. Require an explicit block (job-level when scopes differ).
- Over-scoped where narrow would do: `contents: write` when `read` suffices; `id-token: write` outside OIDC / provenance jobs; `pull-requests: write` outside bot-comment jobs.
- `secrets: inherit` to a reusable workflow — flag and request an explicit secret list.

### Secret exposure in workflows (HIGH)

Cross-check `references/secrets.md` for the canonical severity and fix patterns; this section narrows the rubric to the `secrets.*` exposure surface in CI workflows specifically.

- `secrets.*` interpolated into a `run:` block where it lands in logs (shell echo, `set -x`, error paths). Use `env:` to bind the secret, then reference `$VAR` inside the script so GitHub's redaction works.
- Secrets passed as arguments to third-party actions whose source is not pinned to a SHA.
- New secret names introduced without a matching reference in the repo's secrets-management doc (if `SECURITY.md` or similar documents them).

## Output expectations

- Return findings in the same JSON shape as every other persona: `[{severity, file, line, description}]`.
- `description` must contain both a literal `WHAT:` clause naming the specific problem AND a literal `FIX:` clause stating the specific change (e.g. specific replacement, action SHA, env-var rewrite). Step 6 grep-matches these markers — findings missing either marker are routed to the malformed-finding path. Generic warnings without a `FIX:` clause are not actionable.
- If no CI-security concerns survive the diff scope, return `[]` — do NOT speculate about workflows that weren't changed.

## Fix rubric

(Consumed by `pr-fix` when generating fixes for individual review comments.)

Apply only the mechanical fixes that have a single correct shape:
- Rewrite `${{ github.event.X }}` → `env: { VAR: ${{ github.event.X }} }`
  + `$VAR` in `run:`. Confirm the `run:` script doesn't itself echo `$VAR`.
- Pin floating action refs to a full commit SHA + trailing tag comment.
  Resolve the SHA from the action's latest tag matching the floating ref.
- Add an explicit `permissions:` block to a workflow that lacked one.
  Default the new block to the **narrowest** scope the workflow's steps
  actually use; flag for human review if any step needs `write`.

**Do not** auto-apply: removing a `pull_request_target` trigger,
changing `secrets:` plumbing across reusable workflows, or modifying
which workflows fire on which events — surface those for human review.

Cross-check `references/injection.md`, `references/secrets.md`, and `references/github-actions.md`.

## Out-of-scope reminders (for the sub-agent)

- Do NOT review release/publish flow or Changesets — `release-integrity`.
- Do NOT review lockfile drift, `.npmrc`, or dependency hygiene — `dependencies`.
- Do NOT review build-script code quality — `correctness`, `simplification`, `performance`.
- Do NOT review test coverage of CI workflows — `tests`.
- Do NOT propose architectural changes to the workflow set (which workflows fire on which events) — keep findings local to the diff.

# React / Next Best Practices

Fires when the diff touches React / Next code (`.jsx` / `.tsx` extension; imports of `react`, `react-dom`, `next/*`, `@tanstack/react-*`, `@apollo/client`; or `'use client'` / `'use server'` directives).

## Run-time setup (MUST do first, in this order)

Discover the rubric SKILL.md paths via Bash:

```bash
REACT_RUBRIC=$(find ~/.claude -type f -name SKILL.md -path "*vercel-react-best-practices*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
COMP_RUBRIC=$(find ~/.claude -type f -name SKILL.md -path "*vercel-composition-patterns*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
NEXT_RUBRIC=$(find ~/.claude -type f -name SKILL.md -path "*next-best-practices*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
NEXT_CACHE_RUBRIC=$(find ~/.claude -type f -name SKILL.md -path "*next-cache-components*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
BUILD_COMP_RUBRIC=$(find ~/.claude -type f -name SKILL.md -path "*building-components*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# React Native rubric is only relevant when the touched files import react-native or expo.
# Detect via the diff: presence of `from 'react-native'`, `from 'expo'`, `from 'expo-*'`, or `.native.tsx` files.
if grep -lE "from ['\"]react-native|from ['\"]expo|\\.native\\.(tsx?|jsx?)" <CHANGED_FILES> >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  RN_RUBRIC=$(find ~/.claude -type f -name SKILL.md -path "*vercel-react-native-skills*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
```

For each of `REACT_RUBRIC`, `COMP_RUBRIC`, `NEXT_RUBRIC`, `NEXT_CACHE_RUBRIC`, `BUILD_COMP_RUBRIC` (and `RN_RUBRIC` when set), if the variable is non-empty, Read the file in full and print `Loaded conditional skill: <name>`. For each that resolved empty, print `Marketplace skill not found: <name> — degrading to persona's built-in rubric below` and continue.

Use the contents of whichever rubric files loaded — plus this persona's built-in rubric below — as the combined review criteria.

## Review focus (apply with the rubric above)

### Server-Components discipline (Next.js App Router)

- Server Component is the default; `'use client'` should sit on the smallest leaf that needs client interactivity. Flag client directives high in the tree where a child would suffice.
- Data fetching: prefer Server Component `fetch` (with caching directives) over client-side hooks where applicable.
- Streaming and Suspense usage — `<Suspense>` boundaries that wrap meaningful UI sections, not the entire route.

### Composition patterns

- Render-prop / compound-component opportunities for boolean-prop explosions (5+ booleans on one component).
- Context provider placement: providers placed too high cause re-render storms; flag context with frequently-changing values not wrapped in `useMemo` or split.
- Prop-drilling that should be context (3+ levels of pass-through props).

### Hooks + effects

- Effect dependency arrays with stale closures (functions captured before the dependency they should track).
- Missing cleanup in `useEffect` (event listeners, intervals, subscriptions, `AbortController`).
- Memoization that creates new identities every render — `useMemo(() => [a, b], [])` with the array re-created each call defeats the purpose.
- Missing or wrong key props on lists (using index when items can reorder; missing keys entirely).
- Unnecessary client-side state when URL state or server state would do.

### React 19 APIs (when applicable)

- `use()` misuse — only valid in Server Components or Suspense-wrapped contexts.
- Actions / `useActionState` / `useOptimistic` correctness.
- Ref-as-prop (React 19) replacing `forwardRef` where appropriate.

## Severity guidance

- **High** — client-server boundary mistakes: server-only code in a `'use client'` file, secrets leaking to client, environment variables exposed without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix being intentional.
- **High** — effect / memoization anti-patterns causing infinite loops or render storms.
- **Medium** — composition smells (boolean-prop explosion, prop-drilling that should be context); effect dependency mistakes that cause stale-state bugs but not crashes.
- **Medium** — `'use client'` placed too high in the tree.
- **Low** — minor memoization opportunities; key-prop nits; client-state where URL state would be marginally better.

## Out-of-scope reminders (for the sub-agent)

- Do NOT review generic type-safety or `any` usage — `code-quality`.
- Do NOT review Tailwind classes, design tokens, or accessibility — `ui-styling-accessibility`.
- Do NOT flag missing tests for React components — `test-coverage`.
- Do NOT review error-handling depth in async hooks (missing `.catch()` etc.) — `silent-failure-hunter`.

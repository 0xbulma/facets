description: Pre-PR local code review. Reviews local branch changes (committed + uncommitted) using parallel specialized agents (6 baseline + conditional Web3, React/Next, styling, accessibility, AI-SDK, CI-security, release-integrity, dependencies, route-UI) and outputs findings in the terminal. Optionally applies fixes with --fix (refuses on dirty tree). Use when user says /local:pr-review-local, "review my changes", "review before PR", "local review", or "deep review".

# review-local — Pre-PR Local Review

Reviews local branch changes using parallel specialized agents from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pr-review-engine/SKILL.md` and outputs findings directly in the terminal. Zero GitHub interaction. Optionally applies fixes with `--fix`.

## Usage

```
/local:pr-review-local                       # review current branch vs default base
/local:pr-review-local <BASE_BRANCH>         # review against an explicit base branch
/local:pr-review-local --fix                 # review and apply fixes (refuses on dirty tree)
/local:pr-review-local <BASE_BRANCH> --fix   # both
```

`<BASE_BRANCH>` is positional and must NOT begin with `--`. Flag order is otherwise free.

## Pre-conditions

- The skill is local-only by design. If `CI=true` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` is detected, print one warning line — `WARNING: local:pr-review-local is for pre-PR local review; this skill family does not ship a CI variant.` — and continue. Do not refuse.

## Validating end-to-end

A maintainer changing this skill should verify each outcome shape:

| Scenario | Expected last line |
|---|---|
| Clean branch, no findings | `Sentinel: REVIEW_CLEAN — no issues found in <HEAD_BRANCH> vs <BASE_BRANCH>.` |
| Findings present | `Sentinel: REVIEW_DONE_LOCAL — <N> findings (X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low) on <HEAD_BRANCH> vs <BASE_BRANCH>.` |
| Findings + agent crash | `Sentinel: REVIEW_DONE_LOCAL — ...` (with a `WARNING: <FAILED_AGENTS> of <TOTAL_AGENTS_LAUNCHED> agents failed (<names>) — review may be incomplete.` line prepended to the findings output) |
| Zero findings + agent crash | `Sentinel: REVIEW_INCOMPLETE — <FAILED_AGENTS> of <TOTAL_AGENTS_LAUNCHED> agents failed (<names>); no findings does NOT mean clean.` |
| `--fix` happy path | `Sentinel: FIX_DONE_LOCAL — <X> applied, <Y> skipped (Local-only, unstaged).` plus `git diff` shows the unstaged edits. |
| `--fix` aborted on dirty tree | `Sentinel: FIX_ABORTED — working tree is not clean. Commit or stash before --fix.` |

Idempotency: re-running with no diff change produces the same sentinel + same counts; finding *text* may drift (LLM nondeterminism). The sentinel structure is deterministic.

## Step 1: Validate environment + arguments

```bash
if [ "${CI:-}" = "true" ] || [ "${GITHUB_ACTIONS:-}" = "true" ]; then
  echo "WARNING: local:pr-review-local is for pre-PR local review; this skill family does not ship a CI variant." >&2
fi
```

Parse positional and flag args:

- If `--fix` is present, set `FIX=1`.
- If a non-flag positional argument is present and does not start with `--`, treat it as `<BASE_BRANCH>`.

## Step 2: Resolve branches

```bash
git fetch origin

HEAD_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ -z "$HEAD_BRANCH" ]; then
  HEAD_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)   # detached HEAD — display only
fi
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

Resolve `<BASE_BRANCH>`:

1. If a positional argument was provided, use it.
2. Otherwise auto-detect the repo's default branch:

```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin 2>/dev/null | grep 'HEAD branch' | sed 's/.*: //' | tr -d '[:space:]')
if [ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
  for candidate in main master; do
    if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$candidate"; then
      BASE_BRANCH=$candidate
      break
    fi
  done
fi
if [ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
  echo "Could not resolve base branch. Pass one explicitly: /local:pr-review-local <BASE_BRANCH>" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Empty-diff short-circuit. Compute the actual commit-range diff before any review work, and stop only if it is empty AND the working tree is clean. Branch-name equality alone is NOT sufficient — a clean tree on `main` with unpushed commits ahead of `origin/main` still has changes to review:

```bash
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base origin/<BASE_BRANCH> HEAD)
COMMIT_RANGE_FILES=$(git diff --name-only "$MERGE_BASE..HEAD")
WORKTREE_DIRTY=$(git status --porcelain)
if [ -z "$COMMIT_RANGE_FILES" ] && [ -z "$WORKTREE_DIRTY" ]; then
  echo "No changes to review on <HEAD_BRANCH> vs <BASE_BRANCH>"
  exit 0
fi
```

## Steps 3–6: Shared review base

**Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pr-review-engine/SKILL.md` and follow Steps 3–6 there**, with:

- `DIFF_SOURCE` = `local` (include uncommitted diff)
- `HEAD_REF` = `HEAD`

The base produces: `FINDINGS`, `DROPPED_FINDINGS`, `FAILED_AGENTS`, `COUNTS`, `DROPPED_COUNTS`, `TOTAL_AGENTS_LAUNCHED`.

## Step 7: Output to terminal

Format directly in the conversation:

```
## Local-only Code Review (local:pr-review-local)

**Branch:** <HEAD_BRANCH> -> <BASE_BRANCH>  |  **Files:** <count>  |  **Range:** <MERGE_BASE_SHORT>..<HEAD_SHA_SHORT>
**Uncommitted files included:** <U>  |  **Mode:** Local-only

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | X     |
| High     | X     |
| Medium   | X     |
| Low      | X     |

### Critical (X)

- **[CRITICAL]** <file_path>:L<line> — <description>
  _Suggestion: <how to fix>_

### High (X)

- **[HIGH]** <file_path>:L<line> — <description>
  _Suggestion: <how to fix>_

### Medium (X)
...
```

**Order findings by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low), not by file.** Re-sort the `FINDINGS` list from Step 6 by severity DESC, then file path ASC, then line ASC, and group under one heading per severity bucket. Each finding shows its `<file_path>:L<line>` inline so the reader can jump to the source. Omit any severity heading whose bucket is empty.

### Audit trail (dropped findings)

If `DROPPED_FINDINGS` is non-empty, after the severity sections print a one-line summary:

```
Audit: dropped <N> finding(s) by scope filter (<out_of_scope> file-level, <pre_existing> line-level, <doc_example> doc-example). Full list: /tmp/pr-review-local-dropped.json
```

Write the `DROPPED_FINDINGS` array to `/tmp/pr-review-local-dropped.json` (each entry tagged with `drop_reason` and, for line-level drops, `distance_to_nearest_changed_line`) so the user can `cat` it and re-introduce a finding if the filter was wrong. Skip both the line and the file entirely when zero findings were dropped.

### Sentinel lines

- Zero findings AND zero agent failures → `Sentinel: REVIEW_CLEAN — no issues found in <HEAD_BRANCH> vs <BASE_BRANCH>.`
- Zero findings BUT non-zero agent failures → `Sentinel: REVIEW_INCOMPLETE — <FAILED_AGENTS> of <TOTAL_AGENTS_LAUNCHED> agents failed (<names>); no findings does NOT mean clean.`
- Non-zero findings → `Sentinel: REVIEW_DONE_LOCAL — <N> findings (X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low) on <HEAD_BRANCH> vs <BASE_BRANCH>.` If `<FAILED_AGENTS>` is also non-zero, prepend a single `WARNING: <FAILED_AGENTS> of <TOTAL_AGENTS_LAUNCHED> agents failed (<names>) — review may be incomplete.` line to the findings output BEFORE the sentinel.

When `FIX=1`: suppress the `REVIEW_DONE_LOCAL` sentinel (Step 7b will emit its own terminal sentinel). `REVIEW_CLEAN` / `REVIEW_INCOMPLETE` still print before falling through.

If `FIX=1`, proceed to **Step 7b**. Otherwise the skill is complete here.

## Step 7b: Apply fixes (only with --fix)

### Pre-condition: refuse on dirty tree

```bash
DIRTY=$(git status --porcelain)
if [ -n "$DIRTY" ]; then
  echo "Sentinel: FIX_ABORTED — working tree is not clean. Commit or stash before --fix." >&2
  echo "Pre-existing uncommitted file(s):" >&2
  printf '%s\n' "$DIRTY" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

If the user wants to keep their work-in-progress, they `git stash push -u`, run `--fix`, then `git stash pop`. The skill stays out of stash management entirely.

### Apply fixes

**Batch by file** — process all findings on a given file as one unit, validate once, revert all-or-nothing. This avoids the silent-destruction bug where a per-finding revert (`git checkout -- <file>`) would wipe earlier successful fixes on the same file along with the failing one.

For each file with findings (files in any order; findings within a file ordered highest severity first):

1. Read the file from the local filesystem.
2. Apply EVERY finding for this file via the Edit tool, accumulating edits.
3. Validate the file once with the project linter. Auto-detect:
   - `biome.json` → `pnpm exec biome check <file>` (or `npx biome check <file>`)
   - `.oxlintrc.json` → `pnpm oxlint -c .oxlintrc.json <file>`
   - `.eslintrc*` → `npx eslint <file>`
   - `pyproject.toml` with ruff config → `ruff check <file>`
   - `Cargo.toml` → `cargo check` (cannot scope to a single file)
   - None of the above → skip linter validation
4. **All-or-nothing revert.** If lint passes, mark every finding for this file as `applied`. If lint fails, run `git checkout -- <file>` to revert the entire file (safe because the pre-condition guarantees the working tree was clean before the loop), and mark every finding for this file as `skipped: lint rejected the batch`. Do NOT report partial success — the user sees a consistent picture in `git diff`.
5. Track per-file outcomes: applied count, skipped count, skip reason.

### Report

```
## Fix Summary (Local-only)

Mode: Local-only (no PR, no commit, no push)
Fixed: X findings
Skipped: Y findings (see notes above)

Changes are unstaged. Review with: git diff
```

End with the sentinel:

```
Sentinel: FIX_DONE_LOCAL — <X> applied, <Y> skipped (Local-only, unstaged).
```

### Hard constraints

- Do NOT stage changes (`git add`).
- Do NOT commit.
- Do NOT push.
- Leave all changes as unstaged modifications so the user can review them with `git diff`.

## Notes

- **No GitHub interaction**. The skill never calls `gh api`. All output stays in the terminal.
- **Refuse on dirty tree** for `--fix`. Clean precondition replaces ~80 lines of stash plumbing and a class of stash-pop-conflict bugs.
- **Pairs with `/local:pr-review-gh`**: workflow is `/local:pr-review-local` (pre-PR feedback) → fix issues → create PR → `/local:pr-review-gh` (GitHub-posted review).

## Sentinel grammar

| Sentinel | Owning step | Trailer grammar |
|---|---|---|
| `REVIEW_CLEAN` | Step 7 | `— no issues found in <HEAD_BRANCH> vs <BASE_BRANCH>.` |
| `REVIEW_INCOMPLETE` | Step 7 | `— <FAILED_AGENTS> of <TOTAL_AGENTS_LAUNCHED> agents failed (<names>); no findings does NOT mean clean.` |
| `REVIEW_DONE_LOCAL` | Step 7 | `— <N> findings (X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low) on <HEAD_BRANCH> vs <BASE_BRANCH>.` |
| `FIX_DONE_LOCAL` | Step 7b | `— <X> applied, <Y> skipped (Local-only, unstaged).` |
| `FIX_ABORTED` | Step 7b pre-flight | `— working tree is not clean. Commit or stash before --fix.` |

name: extract-plan
version: 1.0.0
description: Convert a technical document (TIB / ADR / RFC / design doc) into a Linear project plan with milestones and issues. Use when user says /local:extract-plan, "extract plan from this doc", "turn this TIB into Linear issues", "create Linear issues from this design doc", or "make a project plan from this RFC". Takes a doc path and optional Linear project name/ID.

# /local:extract-plan — Document → Linear Project Plan

Read a technical document (TIB, ADR, RFC, design doc, etc.) and generate a Linear project plan with milestones and implementation issues from it.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` should contain: `<doc-file-path> [linear-project-name-or-id]`
- Example: `/local:extract-plan docs/tibs/TIB-2026-04-30-rate-limiting.md "Rate Limiting"`

## Pre-conditions

Requires the **Linear MCP server** (`mcp__linear__*` tools). If those tools are not available in the session, stop before Step 3 and tell the user to connect Linear (e.g. `claude mcp add linear`) — do not fabricate issue IDs or fall back to another tracker.

## Instructions

You are converting a technical document into an actionable Linear project plan with milestones and issues. The goal is to bridge the gap between a written decision or design and trackable implementation work.

The input document may be a TIB, ADR, RFC, design doc, or any structured technical document that describes a decision, approach, and/or implementation plan.

---

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Check `$ARGUMENTS`:

- If **two arguments** are provided, treat the first as the document file path and the second as the Linear project name or ID.
- If **one argument** is provided, treat it as the document file path and ask the user for the target Linear project.
- If **no arguments** are provided, ask:
  1. _"Which document should I convert? (file path)"_
  2. _"Which Linear project should the issues be created in? (project name or ID, or 'new' to create one)"_

If the user says "new", you will create the project in Step 5.

### Step 2: Read and Parse the Document

Read the document and extract structured information. Adapt to whatever sections and format are present — the following are common patterns, not requirements:

| Common Section               | What to extract                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Metadata**                 | Status, Date, Author, Scope                                        |
| **Context / Background**     | Problem statement and motivation — becomes project description     |
| **Decision Drivers / Goals** | Constraints and priorities — informs issue prioritization          |
| **Decision / Approach**      | The chosen approach and its subsections — primary source for tasks |
| **Implementation Phases**    | Phase breakdown — maps directly to milestones                      |
| **Consequences / Tradeoffs** | Positive/Negative/Neutral — informs acceptance criteria            |
| **Future Considerations**    | Items explicitly deferred — may become backlog issues              |
| **References**               | Links and prior art — attached to relevant issues                  |

If the document doesn't follow any of these patterns, use your judgment to identify the decision, approach, and actionable work items.

**Scope detection:** Use the document's `Scope` field (if present) and its file path to suggest a target team. Common patterns:

- A monorepo path like `packages/<pkg>/` or `apps/<app>/` usually maps to the team that owns that package/app.
- Root-level configs (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `.github/`) or cross-package changes usually map to a platform / infra / repo-wide team.
- A doc path like `docs/tibs/` or `docs/rfcs/` is metadata, not scope — derive scope from the doc's content instead.

If `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` contains a Team IDs table (a mapping from team name to Linear team ID), use that to resolve the team ID. Otherwise ask the user which Linear team to file under, and offer to record the answer in `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`) for future runs.

### Step 3: Generate the Plan

Build the following structure from the parsed document:

#### 3a: Milestones

If the document contains explicit phases (e.g., "Implementation Phases", "Rollout Plan", "Milestones"):

- Each phase becomes a **Linear milestone** within the project.
- Milestone name: `Phase N: <phase title>` (e.g., `Phase 1: Foundation`)
- Milestone description: The phase's description from the document, verbatim or lightly cleaned up.
- Milestones are ordered sequentially.

If the document does **not** have explicit phases, derive logical milestones from the approach section's subsections or propose a sensible breakdown (e.g., "Foundation", "Core Implementation", "Migration", "Polish"). Ask the user to confirm derived milestones.

#### 3b: Issues

Break the document into actionable implementation issues. Sources for issues:

1. **Approach/Decision subsections** — Each subsection typically maps to one or more issues.
2. **Implementation Phases** — Tasks described within each phase.
3. **Negative consequences/tradeoffs** — May warrant mitigation issues.
4. **Future Considerations** — Items worth tracking as low-priority issues.

**Granularity principle:** Prefer coarser issues that represent a single PR's worth of work. Don't split tightly coupled work into separate issues — for example, writing tests for a feature belongs in the same issue as implementing that feature, not as a separate issue blocked by it. A good heuristic: if two tasks would naturally be done in the same PR by the same person, they should be one issue.

For each issue, determine:

- **Title**: Follow the title convention used by the repo (conventional-commits-style if the repo uses it: `feat(scope): …`, `fix(scope): …`, `chore: …`).
- **Description**: Use the 3-section template below:

  ```markdown
  ## Context
  [What this task accomplishes and why, referencing the source document]

  ## References
  - Source: <doc-file-path> (Section X.Y)
  - [file paths, related issues, or links from the document's References section]

  ## Possible solution
  > AI-generated — treat as a starting point, not a prescription.

  [Implementation approach derived from the document's details]
  ```

- **Milestone**: Which milestone (phase) this issue belongs to.
- **Dependencies**: Which other issues must be completed first (`blockedBy`) and which issues this unblocks (`blocks`). Derive from:
  - Phase ordering (Phase 1 issues block Phase 2 issues where a real dependency exists)
  - Logical dependencies within a phase (e.g., "create package" blocks "add logging module")
  - Explicit dependency mentions in the document
  - Do **not** create artificial cross-milestone blocking for every issue pair — only where a real dependency exists.
- **Priority**: Infer from the document:
  - Critical path / blockers → 1 (Urgent)
  - Core decision items / Phase 1 → 2 (High)
  - Later phases → 3 (Normal)
  - Future considerations → 4 (Low)
- **Estimate** (optional, in points):
  - 1 = Small (single file, straightforward)
  - 2 = Medium (multiple files, some complexity)
  - 3 = Large (cross-cutting, new abstractions)
  - 5 = XL (major effort, consider breaking down further)
- **Labels**: Infer from issue type (label names as an array, e.g. `["Feature"]`). Only use labels that already exist on the team — list them with `mcp__linear__list_labels` if unsure.

#### 3c: Dependency Graph

Build an explicit ordering of issues. Within a milestone, issues should be ordered by their dependency chain. Across milestones, only set blocking relationships where a real dependency exists.

### Step 4: Present the Plan for Review

Before creating anything in Linear, present the full plan to the user:

```
## Document → Linear Plan

**Source**: <doc-file-path>
**Project**: <project-name> (existing | new)
**Team**: <team-name> (<team-key>)
**Total milestones**: N
**Total issues**: N

---

### Milestone 1: <name>
| #  | Title                                              | Priority | Estimate | Blocked By | Blocks |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1  | feat(core): scaffold rate-limit hooks              | High     | 2        | —          | #2, #3 |
| 2  | feat(core): implement token-bucket strategy        | High     | 2        | #1         | #4     |

### Milestone 2: <name>
| #  | Title                                              | Priority | Estimate | Blocked By | Blocks |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 5  | feat(api): adopt rate-limit middleware             | Normal   | 2        | #4         | #6     |

### Dependency Graph
#1 → #2 → #4 → #5 → ...
#1 → #3 ─┐
          └→ #6
```

Then ask:

> **Does this plan look good?** You can:
>
> - Say **"create all"** to create the project, milestones, and all issues
> - Say **"create milestones 1-2 only"** to create a subset
> - **Edit** any item (e.g., "change #3 title to ...", "move #5 to milestone 1", "remove #8")
> - **Add** items (e.g., "add an issue for writing migration docs")
> - Say **"skip"** to cancel without creating anything

### Step 5: Create in Linear

Once the user approves, create items in this order:

#### 5a: Project (if new)

If the user said "new" or no existing project was specified, create the project using `mcp__linear__create_project`:

- `name`: Project name
- `description`: Include Vision (from document context), Motivation (from decision drivers/goals), Scope, and a link to the source document path
- `addTeams`: `[<team-id>]`

If the document status is "Proposed" or "Draft", note in the description that the underlying decision may still change.

#### 5b: Milestones

Create milestones in order using `mcp__linear__create_milestone`:

- `name`: `Phase N: <title>`
- `description`: Phase description from the document
- `project`: The project ID

#### 5c: Issues (two-pass)

**Pass 1 — Create issues** in dependency order (issues with no `blockedBy` first) using `mcp__linear__create_issue`:

- `title`: Title following the repo's title convention
- `description`: 3-section template (Context / References / Possible solution)
- `team`: Team ID (from scope detection)
- `project`: Project ID
- `milestone`: Milestone name or ID
- `priority`: 1-4
- `estimate`: 1, 2, 3, or 5
- `labels`: Label names as an array, e.g. `["Feature"]`
- `state`: Default all issues to **Backlog** state unless explicitly overridden by the user

Store each returned issue ID.

**Pass 2 — Set dependencies** by updating each issue that has relationships:

- `id`: The created issue identifier
- `blockedBy`: Array of blocking issue identifiers
- `blocks`: Array of blocked issue identifiers

This two-pass approach avoids forward-reference problems where issue B depends on issue C that hasn't been created yet.

### Step 6: Confirm Completion

Present a summary:

```
## Created from <doc-file-name>

**Project**: <project-name>
<project-linear-url>

### Milestones
1. Phase 1: <title> — N issues
2. Phase 2: <title> — N issues

### Issues Created (N total)
| ID            | Title                                            | Milestone | Blocked By  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| <TEAM>-101    | feat(core): scaffold rate-limit hooks            | Phase 1   | —           |
| <TEAM>-102    | feat(core): implement token-bucket strategy      | Phase 1   | <TEAM>-101  |

### Dependency Chain
<TEAM>-101 → <TEAM>-102 → <TEAM>-104 → <TEAM>-105 → ...
```

## Notes

- Always resolve project names to IDs before creating artifacts — use `mcp__linear__list_projects` to find the ID if only a name is provided
- Issue descriptions must follow the 3-section template (Context / References / Possible solution)
- Issue titles should follow whatever convention the repo uses (often conventional commits)
- If team IDs are not listed in `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, ask the user which Linear team to use and offer to record the answer for future runs
- Create issues in dependency order so that `blockedBy` references are valid
- If the document has no explicit phases, derive milestones from logical groupings and confirm with the user
- Do NOT create a git branch — this command creates Linear artifacts only

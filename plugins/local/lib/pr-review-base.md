# local-review base — shared Steps 3–6

This file is the shared review base for the personal `local-review-*` slash commands. It is invoked indirectly via:

- `/local:pr-review-gh` — Local PR review (post as `COMMENT`); supports `--watch`
- `/local:pr-review-local` — pre-PR local review (terminal-only); supports `--fix`

Do NOT invoke this file directly. It assumes the caller has resolved branches and head SHA in its own Steps 1–2.

The base contract: callers pass resolved values into Steps 3–6 and consume the deduplicated findings list + `<FAILED_AGENTS>` count produced by Step 6.

## Inputs (from caller's Steps 1–2)

| Caller-provided | Source |
|---|---|
| `<OWNER>`, `<REPO>` | parsed from git remote |
| `<HEAD_BRANCH>` | `gh pr view` → `headRefName` (PR mode) OR `git branch --show-current` (Local) |
| `<BASE_BRANCH>` | `gh pr view` → `baseRefName` (PR mode) OR auto-detected default branch (Local) |
| `<HEAD_SHA>` | `gh pr view` → `headRefOid` (PR mode) OR `git rev-parse HEAD` (Local) |
| `<DIFF_SOURCE>` | `pr` (use `origin/<BASE>...origin/<HEAD>`) OR `local` (use `origin/<BASE>...HEAD` and overlay uncommitted) |
| `<HEAD_REF>` | `origin/<HEAD_BRANCH>` for `<DIFF_SOURCE>=pr`, `HEAD` for `<DIFF_SOURCE>=local` |

## Step 3: Get the diff locally

**Use the local repo on disk, NOT the GitHub API.**

Compute the merge-base and the diff:

```bash
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base origin/<BASE_BRANCH> <HEAD_REF>)

git diff $MERGE_BASE..<HEAD_REF>
git diff --name-only $MERGE_BASE..<HEAD_REF>
```

If `<DIFF_SOURCE>=local` AND uncommitted changes exist, also include them:

```bash
git diff HEAD                  # combined staged + unstaged
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

Combine the two file lists, deduplicate, announce the count of uncommitted files included so the user knows the review covers their full work-in-progress:

> "Including X uncommitted file(s) in the review."

If both diffs are empty, return an empty result to the caller (it will emit the appropriate "no changes to review" sentinel).

Read each changed file from the local filesystem using the Read tool so agents have full file context (not just diff hunks).

## Step 4: Read project context (adaptive)

Before launching review agents, read project-level documentation that defines the rules and intent of the repo. Store what you find as `<PROJECT_CONTEXT>` and pass it to each agent in Step 5.

### Always read (root-level baseline)

For each file below, read **only** if it exists. Prefer `AGENTS.md` over `CLAUDE.md` to avoid double-reading when one is a symlink to the other:

1. `AGENTS.md` (root). If absent, fall back to `CLAUDE.md` (root).
2. `MISSION.md` — mission, scope, and values (if present).
3. `CONTRIBUTING.md` — dev setup, contribution flow.
4. Lint/format contract: any of `biome.json`, `.eslintrc*`, `.oxlintrc.json`, `.prettierrc*`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod` — read whichever exist, to know the lint/format expectations.

### Conditional baseline (read when relevant)

5. `SECURITY.md` — read if any security-relevant code is touched (auth, crypto, parsers, network entry points, secrets handling, onchain contract calls, wallet operations, CI / publish flow).
6. `docs/jsdoc-style.md` (or similar JSDoc / docstring style guide) — read whenever the diff touches an exported symbol with JSDoc.

### Per-package context (only for packages touched by the diff)

For each unique package directory among the changed files (e.g. a file at `packages/foo/src/bar.ts` belongs to package `packages/foo`), read:

1. `<pkg>/AGENTS.md` — package-specific refinements (refines the root for this package; root wins on contradictions). If absent, fall back to `<pkg>/CLAUDE.md`.
2. `<pkg>/README.md` — public-facing description.
3. `<pkg>/ARCHITECTURE.md` — if present.
4. Any other top-level `*.md` in the package directory.
5. Nested `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) along the path of touched files (at any depth — e.g. `packages/foo/src/handlers/AGENTS.md`).

Use the Glob tool: `**/AGENTS.md` and `**/CLAUDE.md`. Filter to paths that prefix at least one changed file's directory. Files outside `packages/` use only items 1–4 of the root baseline (items 5–6 conditional as triggered).

### Detect framework / domain signals (used by Step 5 conditional personas)

Compute boolean flags from the diff and from changed files' content. These flags drive which conditional personas launch in Step 5:

- `<HAS_WEB3>` — true if any changed file imports a contract-interaction library (`viem`, `wagmi`, `ethers`, `web3.js` — extend per project with any org-specific Web3 SDK imports, e.g. `@your-org/*`), or contains contract address constants (`0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}`), or contract interaction patterns (`useContractRead`, `useContractWrite`, `readContract`, `writeContract`, `simulateContract`, `signTypedData`, `permit*`).
- `<HAS_REACT>` — true if any changed file has extension `.jsx`/`.tsx`, OR imports `react`, `react-dom`, `next/*`, `@tanstack/react-*`, `@apollo/client`, OR contains `'use client'` / `'use server'` directives.
- `<HAS_TAILWIND>` — true if `<HAS_REACT>` AND any changed file contains a Tailwind-shaped class string (regex match in JSX: `className="[^"]*\b(flex|grid|p-[0-9]|m-[0-9]|text-|bg-|border-|rounded-)`).
- `<HAS_STYLING>` — true if any changed file imports `styled-components`, `@emotion/*`, `tss-react`, `*.module.css`, `*.module.scss`, OR contains a11y attributes (`role=`, `aria-`, `tabIndex`).
- `<HAS_CI_RELEASE>` — true if any changed file matches `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/actions/**`, `.changeset/**`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `.npmrc` (any level), `turbo.json`, `vercel.json`, OR any `package.json` whose `scripts.*publish*` / `scripts.*release*` / `scripts.*deploy*` field is modified, OR any file containing `changeset publish`, `npm publish`, `pnpm publish`, `gh release create`, `vercel deploy`, or `vercel --prod`.
- `<HAS_AI_SDK>` — true if any changed file imports `ai`, `@ai-sdk/*`, `@vercel/ai`, OR uses any of `streamText`, `generateText`, `streamObject`, `generateObject`, `embed`, `embedMany`, `useChat`, `useCompletion`, `useObject`, `ToolLoopAgent`, OR imports `ai-elements` or `streamdown`.

### Print discovery

After context discovery, print the list of files read and the flags so the user can spot omissions:

```
Context files read (N):
  AGENTS.md (root)
  CONTRIBUTING.md
  packages/foo/AGENTS.md
  ...

Conditional flags:
  Web3:           <HAS_WEB3>
  React/Next:     <HAS_REACT>
  Tailwind:       <HAS_TAILWIND>
  Styling/a11y:   <HAS_STYLING>
  CI/release:     <HAS_CI_RELEASE>
  AI SDK:         <HAS_AI_SDK>
```

## Step 5: Launch parallel review personas

Persona specs live in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/*.md`. Each file has frontmatter declaring `kind: baseline` (always fires) or `kind: conditional` (fires only when its `trigger:` flag is true), plus the prompt body.

### Loop

1. Read every file in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/*.md`.
2. For each persona, decide whether to launch:
   - `kind: baseline` → always launch.
   - `kind: conditional` → launch only when the flag named in `trigger:` is true (see Step 4 for flag computation). Compound triggers like `<HAS_TAILWIND> OR <HAS_STYLING>` are evaluated as written.
3. Launch ALL selected personas **in parallel** using the Agent tool (subagent_type: `"general-purpose"`).
4. Track `<TOTAL_AGENTS_LAUNCHED>` = count of personas actually launched (baseline + any fired conditionals).

### Shared per-agent contract (applied uniformly to every launched persona)

- Each agent receives: full diff, full content of changed files (read from local FS), `<PROJECT_CONTEXT>` from Step 4, the conditional flag values, the persona file body, the repo path / branches.
- Per-package `AGENTS.md` rules refine the root for the specific package; the root wins on contradictions.
- Agents must analyze the **full diff**, not just the latest commit.
- Each agent **must return** a JSON array `[{severity: "critical"|"high"|"medium"|"low", file: "path", line: number, description: "what is wrong + how to fix"}]` OR an explicit error sentinel `{"agent_error": "<reason>"}` if it could not complete (the aggregator in Step 6 distinguishes "no findings" from "agent failed").
- **Stay in scope (avoid scope creep).** Focus on the diff: flag issues introduced by these changes, and issues in adjacent code only when the diff makes that adjacent code materially worse (e.g. a renamed function whose remaining callers now misbehave, a new code path that exposes an existing bug). Do NOT flag pre-existing issues in unchanged lines of changed files, propose unrelated refactors, suggest new features or abstractions, or recommend cleanups outside the PR's intent. When in doubt, omit — the reviewer is reviewing *this change*, not the file's history.
- Only **actionable** findings — no praise, no summaries.

### Current persona inventory

Baseline (always fire):

- `code-quality.md` — type discipline, code smells, naming, security primitives, cross-file impact.
- `silent-failure-hunter.md` — swallowed errors, missing error states, dead code paths.
- `documentation.md` — JSDoc on exports + Markdown doc accuracy + pointer/link integrity + (when project uses a persona system) bidirectional backlink consistency.
- `test-coverage.md` — missing tests, plus layout enforcement (colocation `src/Foo.test.ts` next to `src/Foo.ts` where the project supports it, `*.integration.test.ts` naming for fork-bound tests).
- `code-simplifier-performance.md` — unnecessary complexity, redundant logic, performance issues.

Conditional (fire only when their trigger flag is true):

- `web3-security.md` — fires when `<HAS_WEB3>` is true. Contract interactions, transaction params, permit flows, chainId validation.
- `react-next-best-practices.md` — fires when `<HAS_REACT>` is true. Loads marketplace rubrics: `vercel-react-best-practices`, `vercel-composition-patterns`, `next-best-practices`, `next-cache-components`, `building-components`, and `vercel-react-native-skills` (only when React Native is detected).
- `ui-styling-accessibility.md` — fires when `<HAS_TAILWIND>` OR `<HAS_STYLING>` is true. Loads `tailwind-design-system`, `web-design-guidelines`, `ai-elements`, `streamdown`, `building-components` as rubric when applicable.
- `ci-release-security.md` — fires when `<HAS_CI_RELEASE>` is true. Workflow injection, action pinning, write-token hardening, lockfile drift, publish-flow integrity. Loads `github-actions-docs`, `turborepo`, `deploy-to-vercel`, `vercel-cli-with-tokens` as rubric.
- `ai-sdk-best-practices.md` — fires when `<HAS_AI_SDK>` is true. Vercel AI SDK usage, streaming, tool calls, structured output, useChat/useCompletion. Loads `ai-sdk`, `ai-elements`, `streamdown` as rubric.

Adding a new persona = drop a new file under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/` with appropriate frontmatter. If conditional, also extend Step 4's flag detection. No edit to caller skill files needed.

## Step 6: Aggregate and deduplicate findings

Merge all agent results into a single list:

1. **Scope filter (drop out-of-scope findings).** Build `<CHANGED_FILES>` = the deduplicated file list from Step 3:
   - committed: `git diff --name-only $MERGE_BASE..<HEAD_REF>`
   - plus uncommitted: `git diff --name-only HEAD` (only when `<DIFF_SOURCE>=local`)

   For every agent finding, first guard `finding.file`: if it is missing, not a string, or empty, treat the finding as malformed and route it to sub-step 2's partial-failure handling instead of dropping it here. Otherwise, compare `finding.file` against `<CHANGED_FILES>` after path normalization:
   - Strip any leading `./`.
   - Strip diff prefixes `a/` and `b/` if present.
   - If the agent returned an absolute path, strip the repo-root prefix (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) before compare.
   - Case-sensitive compare (matches git's default).

   If `finding.file` is not in `<CHANGED_FILES>`, **drop the finding** and increment `<DROPPED_OUT_OF_SCOPE>`.

   Do NOT filter by line number within a changed file. The Step 5 contract permits flagging adjacent code in a changed file when the diff materially worsens it, so line-level filtering would discard legitimate findings.

   After the loop, print one log line: `Scope filter: dropped <DROPPED_OUT_OF_SCOPE> finding(s) targeting files outside the diff.` Then proceed to the remaining sub-steps on the surviving findings.

   Note: dropped findings do NOT count toward `<FAILED_AGENTS>` — they are valid output that was simply out of scope, not malformed.

2. **Count agent failures.** An agent counts as failed if any of these hold:
   - Returned `{"agent_error": "..."}` (the explicit sentinel from Step 5).
   - Returned text that is not parseable as JSON.
   - Returned a JSON value that is not an array (e.g. an object that is not the error sentinel).
   - Returned an array containing one or more objects missing required fields (`severity` not in `critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`, missing or non-string `file`, missing or non-numeric `line`, missing or empty `description`) — count the agent as **partially failed**: keep the valid findings from that agent, but include the agent in `<FAILED_AGENTS>` so the report flags it.

   Track `<FAILED_AGENTS>` as a count plus the names. This count flows into the caller's Step 7 reporting so a "no findings" verdict is never reported when some agents crashed.

3. **Deduplicate** with this rule (do NOT collapse genuinely distinct findings):
   - Findings on the SAME file at the EXACT same line are duplicates ONLY when their descriptions overlap meaningfully (≥50% token overlap, or one is a clear paraphrase of the other). Keep the one with the higher severity; if descriptions don't overlap, keep BOTH.
   - Findings within ±3 lines but on the same file are merged ONLY when severities AND descriptions overlap.
   - When merging, keep the higher-severity finding's text.

4. Sort by: file path (alphabetical, ASC), then line number (ASC), then severity (DESC).

Severity labels (used everywhere downstream):

- `critical` → Critical
- `high` → High
- `medium` → Medium
- `low` → Low

## Output contract (returned to caller)

The caller (Step 7 of `/local:pr-review-gh` / `/local:pr-review-local`) consumes:

- `<FINDINGS>` — sorted, deduplicated array of `{severity, file, line, description}`.
- `<FAILED_AGENTS>` — count + names of agents that returned `agent_error` or malformed output.
- `<COUNTS>` — `{critical, high, medium, low}` totals.
- `<TOTAL_AGENTS_LAUNCHED>` — 5 baseline + count of conditional personas that fired (`<HAS_WEB3>` + `<HAS_REACT>` + `(<HAS_TAILWIND> OR <HAS_STYLING>)` + `<HAS_CI_RELEASE>`). Used by the caller's report to phrase `<FAILED_AGENTS> of <TOTAL_AGENTS_LAUNCHED> agents failed`.

The caller formats and routes these per its mode (GitHub COMMENT / terminal output).
